Please complete the merchant enquiry form or send us an email with your details to grow@payflex.co.za. Our experienced sales team will then give you a call and get you up and running in as little as a day.

= What does Payflex cost? =

Payflex offers a very simple fee structure, with no upfront fees or fees for refunds, failed payments or authorisations. Payflex simply charges a per-transaction fee on successful transactions only. Our Partnership Managers will discuss the details – but our philosophy is keep it simple and transparent.

= What is the minimum contract term? =

We don’t believe in tying our merchants into long-term commitments. We’re in the partnership business and want to work with you to grow your business. If Payflex doesn’t work for you then turn us off.

That’s our problem. You get 100% of the purchase amount (less the Payflex fee) paid in full upfront.
